        <p>We are a team dedicated to empowering women with accessible information about their health. Recognizing the prevalence and potential impact of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), we developed this PCOS Prediction Tool to facilitate early awareness.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to provide a user-friendly platform where individuals can input basic health-related information and receive a preliminary assessment of their potential risk for PCOS. We believe that increased awareness can encourage timely consultation with healthcare professionals, leading to earlier diagnosis, treatment, and improved quality of life for those affected by PCOS.</p>

        <p>To empower women by providing an accessible tool for the early prediction of PCOS, thereby promoting proactive health management and informed decision-making.</p>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
